### Setting up local editing environment

1. Install python 3 and pipenv:

    ```
    python3 -m pip install pipenv
    ```

2. Start local documentation server:

    ```
    ./local_server.sh
    ```

    If everything is fine, you should see output similar to:

    ```
    [I 201022 09:01:06 server:335] Serving on http://127.0.0.1:8000
    INFO    -  Serving on http://127.0.0.1:8000
    [I 201022 09:01:06 handlers:62] Start watching changes
    INFO    -  Start watching changes
    [I 201022 09:01:06 handlers:64] Start detecting changes
    INFO    -  Start detecting changes
    ```

3. Open browser at <!-- markdown-link-check-disable-line --> <http://127.0.0.1:8000>

Place your text editor side-by-side with a browser window if you want to have preview of your edits - browser will
keep refreshing each time you update documents.

### Quick fixes directly from web

For quick edits/suggestions, edit links ("edit this page" at the top right corner) and create text suggestions directly
from web. See [GitHub documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/github/managing-files-in-a-repository/editing-files-in-your-repository)
if you're unfamiliar with the workflow.

### Linter

Required tools:

* Docker

To run the markdown linter which also fixes small issues automatically:
