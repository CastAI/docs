# Dashboard

In the dashboard window, you will see all active and deleted clusters.

1. Create a new cluster. If you can see only an option to create a cluster, please refer to [Getting started](../getting-started.md) to unlock other features.
2. Download `kubeconfig` of a cluster, pause, or delete it.
3. You can open any specific cluster to manage its policies, add or remove nodes or check logs (check -> [/clusters](../console-overview/console-overview.md#clusters)). Copy cluster ID for API management.
