# Overview

This guide will help you get started and deploy your first cluster with CAST AI.

To start using CAST AI you will need:

- An account - [sign up here](https://console.cast.ai/signup)
- Cloud credentials - [join slack and claim free trial](https://join.slack.com/t/castai-community/shared_invite/zt-kxomy09z-p_tbccVJ61azObIt~GUjXQ)
- An application developed on Kubernetes

Refer to the table of contents on the right side to quickly navigate through this document.

**Estimated time to get started - 5-10 minutes.**

## Add cloud credentials

!!! tip
    You can skip this step if you have a free trial activated.

CAST AI will need your cloud credentials to call cloud APIs, so the platform can create, orchestrate and optimize clusters for you. CAST AI does not store your credentials or password. You can opt-out and remove them any time you want.

If you remove the credentials - you are free to use the Kubernetes provisioned cluster as it is but you will lose all the managed service benefits and features that CAST AI offers.

## Create cluster

Once you have [cloud credentials](../getting-started/#add-cloud-credentials) - you are ready to create a cluster. In the cluster creation window you will have a few options to lay a base foundation for your cluster, which we will be able to further customize to your needs once a cluster is up and running.

**1. Cluster details**

The new cluster will be created with the name and in the region, you specify here.
After the cluster is created, name and region canâ€™t be changed.

   - Name your cluster (2-50 symbols, only letters, numbers, and hyphens allowed)

   - Select a region. Your cluster will be located in the selected region.
   
**2. Cluster configuration**

Select initial cluster configuration. It may be automatically adjusted based on scaling and cost optimization policies. You will be able to adjust policies once the cluster is created. You may also manually add nodes once the cluster is provisioned.

**3. Cloud providers**

Select the cloud provider(s) you would like to use for this cluster. You will need to select credentials that you would like to use for each provider, please refer to [Adding credentials] section if you have no credentials added.

**4. Cluster virtual private network**

Select preferred encrypted connection type. Cloud provided VPN is a default VPN provided by the respective cloud service providers. WireGuard is a CAST AI integrated choice of VPN that [significantly reduces cloud cost].

- WireGuard VPN: Full Mesh - network traffic is encrypted between all nodes
- WireGuard VPN: Cross Location Mesh - network traffic is encrypted only between nodes in different clouds
- Cloud provided VPN - default network encryption provided by selected CSPs

## Deploy application

CAST AI managed cluster runs on Kubernetes. Once you have a cluster running - you can download a **`kubeconfig` file** of the cluster and deploy your application using **`kubectl`** command-line tool.
