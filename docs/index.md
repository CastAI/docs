# Welcome to CAST AI documentation

CAST AI is an intelligent engine that uses your cloud service accounts to create the cloud resources you need and sets
up a multi-cloud cluster for you. You can start using multi-cloud Kubernetes with just a few clicks.

The documentation is divided into the following sections:

* **Concepts**: if you're new to CAST AI, [read this first](concepts/how-it-works.md).
* **Getting started**: cluster administrator's reference.
* **Developer guides**: configuring deployments, volumes, scaling policies, etc.
* **API**: CAST AI API authentication, specification and Terraform support.
