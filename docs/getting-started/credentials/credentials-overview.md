    You can skip this step if you have a free trial activated - jump to [create cluster](../../getting-started/create-cluster.md)

CAST AI will need your cloud credentials to call cloud APIs, so the platform can create, orchestrate and optimize clusters for you. CAST AI does not store your credentials or password. You can opt-out and remove them any time you want.

If you remove the credentials - you are free to use the Kubernetes provisioned cluster as it is but you will lose all the managed service benefits and features that CAST AI offers.

Guides to add credentials:

- [Amazon Web Services](../credentials/configuring-aws-credentials.md)
- [Azure](../credentials/configuring-azure-credentials.md)
- [Google Cloud Platform](../credentials/configuring-gcp-credentials.md)
