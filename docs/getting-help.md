# Getting help

Getting stuck sucks. That's why CAST AI has a few different ways of getting help:

**Community channels**: Our customer support, developers and community members are willing to find the answers!

On Discord: <https://discord.gg/4sFCFVJ>

Or Slack: <https://join.slack.com/t/castai-community/shared_invite/zt-i8fcn2xi-sM_iONKn35NmYR2E3dtfng>

**Live chat or email:**  You can reach our customer support team via email: support@cast.ai or live chat on our [website](https://cast.ai).

## Security bugs

We strongly encourage you to report security vulnerabilities or any other bug to our email: Bugbounty@cast.ai - first, before disclosing them publicly.
